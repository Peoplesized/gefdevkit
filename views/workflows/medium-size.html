<p>The GEF describes it’s full project cycle <a href="http://www.thegef.org/gef/project_cycle">here</a>. This page presents the workflow for an MSP from a project developer point of view.</p>
<p>MSPs are available through expedited procedures that speed processing (compared to FSPs). The process is even faster if the project doesn’t require project preparation resources.</p>
<p><strong>MSP workflow 1:</strong>
For an MSP that DOES require PPG resources, the process is essentially the same as an <a href="/full-size.html">FSP workflow</a>, except the document goes to the CEO (rather than Council members) for final approval.</p>
<p><strong>MSP workflow 2:</strong>
For an MSP that DOESN’T require PPG resources, the process is straightforward, referred to as a 1-step MSP:</p>
<h2 id="step-1-project-idea">Step 1. Project Idea</h2>
<p>The proponent pursues a partnership with a GEF Agency and GEF Operational Focal Point(s) for endorsement of the initial project concept. We recommend using the <a href="/templates.html#pre-pif">pre-PIF</a> format as a basis for these discussions.</p>
<p>Circulate draft pre-PIF to key stakeholders for feedback and agreement. The concept should go to the relevant staff at the GEF secretariat for guidance on whether a 1-step MSP is a suitable modality before embarking on further development.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-one-step-msp">Step 2. One-step MSP</h2>
<p>Develop the draft 1-step MSP proposal. You can use <a href="/templates.html#1-msp">1-step MSP collaboration template</a> within your project team, to make it easy to work on different sections at the same time and avoid issues of version control. Remember to get the latest official 1-step MSP template (for GEF Trust Fund or LDCF/SCCF) for official communication.</p>
<p>It’s likely that there will be preparation activities such as consultations, brief studies, etc but (in the case of 1-step MSPs) these would be supported by non-GEF resources.</p>
<p>After the appropriate review and sign-off, the implementing agency will make the official submission of the 1-step MSP to the GEF secretariat.</p>
<p>The project can be approved by the CEO. It might also be returned with comments, guide for implementation and/or a request to resubmit.</p>
