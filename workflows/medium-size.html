    <p>The GEF describes it’s full project cycle <a href=
    "http://www.thegef.org/gef/project_cycle">here</a>. This page presents the
    workflow for an MSP from a project developer point of view.</p>

    <p>MSPs are available through expedited procedures that speed processing
    (compared to FSPs). The process is even faster if the project doesn’t
    require project preparation resources.</p>

    <p><strong>MSP workflow 1:</strong> For an MSP that DOES require PPG
    resources, the process is essentially the same as an <a href=
    "/full-size.html">FSP workflow</a>, except the document goes to the CEO
    (rather than Council members) for final approval.</p>

    <p><strong>MSP workflow 2:</strong> For an MSP that DOESN’T require PPG
    resources, the process is straightforward, referred to as a 1-step MSP:</p>

    <h2 id="step-1-project-idea">Step 1. Project Idea</h2>

    <p>The proponent pursues a partnership with a GEF Agency and GEF
    Operational Focal Point(s) for endorsement of the initial project concept.
    We recommend using the <a href="/templates.html#pre-pif">pre-PIF</a> format
    as a basis for these discussions.</p>

    <p>Circulate draft pre-PIF to key stakeholders for feedback and agreement.
    The concept should go to the relevant staff at the GEF secretariat for
    guidance on whether a 1-step MSP is a suitable modality before embarking on
    further development.</p>

    <h2 id="step-2-one-step-msp">Step 2. One-step MSP</h2>

    <p>Develop the draft 1-step MSP proposal. You can use <a href=
    "/templates.html#1-msp">1-step MSP collaboration template</a> within your
    project team, to make it easy to work on different sections at the same
    time and avoid issues of version control. Remember to get the latest
    official 1-step MSP template (for GEF Trust Fund or LDCF/SCCF) for official
    communication.</p>

    <p>It’s likely that there will be preparation activities such as
    consultations, brief studies, etc but (in the case of 1-step MSPs) these
    would be supported by non-GEF resources.</p>

    <p>After the appropriate review and sign-off, the implementing agency will
    make the official submission of the 1-step MSP to the GEF secretariat.</p>

    <p>The project can be approved by the CEO. It might also be returned with
    comments, guide for implementation and/or a request to resubmit.</p>
